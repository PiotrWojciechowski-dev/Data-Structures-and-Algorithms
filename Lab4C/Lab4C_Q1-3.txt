Q1 The only difference between a binary operator and a function is the syntax when calling them.
Arguements in an operator are given before and after the binary operator (+,-,*,/) while functions
only take arguments to the right only.

Q2 No you can't because when overloading operators one of the arguments must be of a class type,
making it impossible to change the behaviour of + for intergers.

Q3 We can't overload << or >> as operators because the first argument must be some io stream like
cout or cin. If we overload them as members of a class the first argument would have to be the
calling object of the class which is not what we want.
